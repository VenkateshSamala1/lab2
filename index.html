        <!-- Addendum -->
        <h2>Addendum</h2>
        <p>Throughout the process of converting this academic paper into HTML, I carefully considered the selection of HTML tags to ensure a well-structured and accessible document. Here's a breakdown of the structural choices made:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;article&gt;</code>: The entire paper is encapsulated within an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag, indicating that it is a standalone piece of content. This choice emphasizes the self-contained nature of the academic paper.</li>
            
            <li><code>&lt;section&gt;</code>: Each major section of the paper is wrapped in individual <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags. This not only enhances the document's organization but also assists in creating a clear hierarchy for both readers and search engines.</li>
            
            <li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>: The use of appropriate heading tags such as <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> for the main title and <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> for section titles ensures a logical structure. Paragraphs are marked up with <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags to maintain readability.</li>

            <li><code>&lt;li&gt;</code>: The new section "Implications for Research and Education" is marked up with an <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag for improved list structure.</li>

            <li><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>: The <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> section includes the last updated information, providing transparency about the document's modification date. JavaScript is employed to dynamically update this content, ensuring accuracy and user awareness of changes.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Additionally, the introduction of minimal CSS styles aims to enhance visual presentation without compromising the document's accessibility. This sets the groundwork for future styling with CSS while prioritizing readability and a positive user experience.</p>
    </article>

    <footer>
        <p>Last updated:
            <span id="lastModified"></span>
        </p>
    </footer>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var x = document.lastModified;
        document.getElementById('lastModified').textContent = x;
    </script>

</body>
